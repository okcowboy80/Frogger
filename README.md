# Frogger
Frogger game made with Ruby and the Gosu library.
I used this project to help solidfy my Ruby language understanding.
This game ("Frogger.rb") starts by having the player cross the highway while avoiding getting hit by a car and collecting insects that the player finds, which increases the player's speed.
The player doesn't die when hit, but gets sent back to the starting point on the sidewalk.
The player can continue progressing through each level with traffic speeding up after each one.
I had fun making it and I am now moving on to bigger things so feel free to try it out and leave me some feedback. 
Thank you.
